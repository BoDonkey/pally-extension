# Pally Extension for ApostropheCMS

Pally Extension is a modern ApostropheCMS module that integrates Pa11y to perform accessibility audits on your website. It provides functionalities to crawl your site, scan pages for accessibility issues, manage scan results, and monitor scan progress â€” all within the ApostropheCMS admin interface.

## Features

- **Automated Accessibility Scanning**: Utilize Pa11y to detect accessibility issues across your website.
- **Sitemap Parsing & Crawling**: Automatically parse your sitemap or perform link crawling to identify pages to scan.
- **Scan Management**: Start, monitor, and cancel scans directly from the admin dashboard.
- **Result Storage**: Stores scan results in a dedicated MongoDB collection for easy access and management.
- **Admin Dashboard Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the ApostropheCMS admin bar and modal interfaces.

## Installation

### Steps

1. **Install the Module**

   Use npm to install the Pally Extension module as a dependency in your ApostropheCMS project:

   ```bash
   npm install @bodonkey/pally-extension
   ```

2. **Configure ApostropheCMS to Use the Module**

   In your `app.js` (or equivalent) file, register the Pally Extension module:

```javascript
     modules: {
       // ... other modules ...

       '@bodonkey/pally-extension': {
         // Module options can be specified here
       }
     }
   };
```

### Database
When this module is installed, it creates a new collection in your MongoDB called pa11y-results. If you uninstall this extension you will need to delete this collection manually.

## Configuration

Pally Extension offers several configurable options to tailor its behavior to your project's needs. These can be set in the module configuration within `app.js`.

### Available Options

  | Option       | Type    | Default | Description                                 |
  | ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
  | `maxPages`   | Number  | `500`   | Maximum number of pages to scan per website. |
  | `includeWarnings` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to include warnings in scan results. |
  | `includeNotices` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to include notices in scan results. |

### Example Configuration

```javascript
modules: {
  '@bodonkey/pally-extension': {
    options: {
      maxPages: 10,
      includeWarnings: false,
      includeNotices: false
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Starting a Scan

- Click on the Pally Dashboard icon added to the admin bar.
- Enter the URL of the website you wish to scan (it is pre-populated with the `baseURL` of your site).
- Select the desired ruleset (e.g., `WCAG2AA`).
- Choose between a full scan or a single-page scan.
- Click the "Start Scan" button.

   The scan will begin asynchronously, and progress will be displayed in real-time.

### Cancelling a Scan
- Scanning numerous pages can take a long time. You can also have an issue where the site scanner follows a link inappropriately and begins the scan of an undesired site. In that case, just click the cancel scan button below the progress bar.

### Viewing Scan History

- Navigate to the `History` section within the Pally Dashboard to view past scan results.
- Each entry includes details such as the scan date, URL, ruleset used, and the number of errors, warnings, and notices found.


### Clearing Scan History

- Use the clear history button below the scan list to delete all scan records.
- To delete a specific scan record, use the delete button within the scan item.
